Noah Sussman's jq Cookbook
===========

How to use jq, [the command-line JSON processor.](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

Avid readers may also wish to avail themselves of a
[jsonlint](https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint) binary.

If you have not used *jq* before then this tutorial will annoy
you. Please refer first to the examples and documentation found in the
very fine [manual](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/).

Or just type `man jq` at the prompt --- everything you need is
documented <a href="http://infiniteundo.com/post/80891241176/how-to-read-a-manpage" >in the manpage</a>
for jq!

jq is a DSL (domain-specific language) so expect to take a day or two
(at least) to read through the manual and fully understand jq's
capabilities.
